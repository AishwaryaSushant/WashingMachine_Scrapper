change without notice. Non-metric weights and measurements are approximate. Some features may require Internet access. Content and services may vary by product and are subject to change without notice. 6/17/21DIMENSIONS AND CLEARANCES
ELECTRICAL REQUIREMENTS• LG recommends the use of LG hoses. Any leaking, 
property damage, or damage to the washing machine 
caused by an improper installation or by the use of 
non-LG hoses is not covered under the terms of the LG 
warranty and is the sole responsibility of the customer 
and/or an installer.• Water supply pressure must be between 20 psi and 
120 psi (138~827 kPa). If the water supply pressure 
is more than 120 psi, a pressure reducing valve must 
be installed.• Inspect the threaded fitting on each hose and make 
sure there is a rubber seal in place in both ends of 
each hose.• Connect the water supply hoses to the HOT and COLD 
water faucets tightly by hand and then tighten another 
2/3 turn with pliers.• Always run a gallon or two of water through each inlet 
hose to flush dirt, scale and other debris out of the 
water lines. Doing so will help prevent future problems 
with clogged filter screens, and will also allow you to 
verify which water line is hot and which is cold.• Attach the hot water line to the hot water inlet on the 
back of the washer. Attach the cold water line to the 
cold water inlet on the back of the washer. Tighten the 
fittings securely. Turn ON both faucets all the way and 
check for leaks at both ends of the hoses.
• The drain hose should always be 
properly secured. Failure to properly 
secure the drain hose can result in 
flooding and property damage.• The drain must be installed in 
accordance with any applicable local 
codes and regulations.• Make sure that the drain hose is not 
stretched, pinched, crushed, or kinked.• Normal height of the end of the hose 
should be approximately 35”~47”  
 (0.9~1.2 m) from the floor.• Do not install the end of the drain 
hose lower than  
29 in. (73.7 cm) or higher than 96 in. 
(243.8 cm) above the bottom of the 
washer or more than 60 in.  
(152.4 cm) away from the washer.• Never create an airtight seal between 
the hose and the drain with tape or 
other means. If no air gap is present, 
water can be siphoned out of the 
tub resulting in poor wash/rinse 
performance or clothing damage.Tie Stra p39”

Tie Stra pDrai n HoseSTANDPIPE Option
LAUNDRY TUB Option• Do not insert the end of 
the drain hose into the 
standpipe more than 8 
inches (20cm). Doing so 
can cause siphoning, 
odors, or improper 
draining.
• Do not use this drain 
hose with a floor drain. 
The end of the drain hose 
must be at least 29 inches 
above the floor for proper 
draining to occur.• The washer should be plugged into a 120-VAC, 60-Hz grounded 3-prong outlet. 
Plug in the washer. Improper connection of the equipment-grounding conductor 
can result in risk of electric shock. Check with a qualified electrician or service 
technician if you are in doubt as to whether the appliance is properly grounded. 
Do not modify the plug provided with the appliance. If it does not fit the outlet, 
have a proper outlet installed by a qualified electrician. Failure to follow these 
warnings can cause serious injury, fire, electrical shock, or death.• The power outlet must be within 60 inches (1.5 m) of either side of the washer.• The appliance and outlet must be positioned so that the plug is easily accessible.• Do not overload the outlet with more than one appliance.• The outlet must be grounded in accordance with current wiring codes and 
regulations.• Time-delay fuse or circuit breaker is recommended.• It is the personal responsibility and obligation of the product owner to have a 
proper outlet installed by a qualified electrician.CONNECTING THE WATER LINES
